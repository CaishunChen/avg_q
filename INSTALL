avg_q: Installation notes
-------------------------

This document includes information on how to compile avg_q yourself.

The current distribution uses the cmake build system: See http://www.cmake.org/
It is recommended that an out-of-tree build is used. This has the advantage that compilation
can be done from a single source tree for multiple architectures, or for debug and production
builds.
Briefly, if you have the source tree set up under /path/to/avg_q, you do the following:
 mkdir /other/path/build; cd /other/path/build
 cmake /path/to/avg_q
 make
 make install
Flags such as switching to debug build can be set by using "ccmake /path/to/avg_q" instead
of cmake as above.

All of the actual method definitions reside in the subdirectory bf/.
The command line driver program is on top level (avg_q.c); the user interface driver program
in the avg_q_ui/ subdirectory.

Including or excluding methods
------------------------------

To build avg_q itself, only a C (and C++) compiler is needed. avg_q is designed so that every
method module contains all information needed by the main program (be it the commandline version or
the GUI version), namely the method name and description, arguments, their types and descriptions etc.
This means that it is easy to build avg_q without any given method, and it is just as easy to
write your own method (copy a simple method such as bf/orthogonalize.c to get started).
Each method module defines a single globally visible function select_{methodname}.
If you have any problems with a particular method or its dependencies, you can easily comment out the
corresponding entry in bf/method_list.c and bf/CMakeLists.txt to proceed without that method.

Steps needed to add your own methods:
 Add the source file itself below bf/
 Add the select_{methodname} declaration to bf/bf.h 
 Add the select_{methodname} function pointer to the list in bf/method_list.c
 Add the source file to bf/CMakeLists.txt (either ALL_SOURCES or, if you created
 an extra subdirectory, the subdirs list) so that cmake knows what to build.
Finished!

Internal support modules
------------------------

Many helper functions reside in bf/trafo_std.c.

avg_q makes heavy use of its own 'growing_buf' data structure (bf/growing_buf.[ch]) and 
its own vector/matrix data structure (bf/array/*).

For solving the general problem that binary file headers cannot be used as C
'struct's directly because of data alignment and byte ordering,
mfx/read_struct.[ch] and mfx/Intel_compat.[ch] are used. This system works by
matching file descriptions to actual C structures to whatever the current C
compiler uses (see *_sm.c files). Mainly as a diagnostic tool, it also
encapsulates the ability to create a descriptive text dump of the binary
structure, with the assistance of extra information contained in *_smd.c
modules. [TODO: Move these files to a place outside of mfx/, which is a formerly
standalone library for the MFX data format rarely used nowadays]


External libraries needed
-------------------------

- For the user interface (avg_q_ui): GTK+ http://www.gtk.org/

- For HDF4 support (read_hdf, write_hdf): HDF4
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf4.html

- For Independent Component Analysis (icadecomp; http://www.cnl.salk.edu/~enghoff/), the
  linear algebra packages lapack and blas are needed (http://www.netlib.org/).
  Additionally, f2c.h is needed and best provided by installing libf2c (http://www.netlib.org/f2c/).

- For sound input/output, the sox library (libsox, current: >=v14) is used if available.
  If libsox presence is not detected on the system at compile time, read_sound
  and write_sound methods will not be built.

Most Linux distributions contain packages for these libraries. To compile avg_q yourself,
it may be necessary to install the development packages of these libraries in addition to
their runtime versions.

Third-party libraries with modifications, included in the current source tree
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- For plotting (needed by posplot): vogl/ http://www.autochthonous.org/eric/index.html

- For Independent Component Analysis (icadecomp): bf/ica/ica.[ch] http://www.cnl.salk.edu/~enghoff/

Windows installation
--------------------

The current distribution is intended for cross-compilation from Linux, using
mingw32. For HDF4, I had to compile the HDF source 4.2r1-hrepack-p4 myself, including
its dependencies jpeg-6b, szip-2.1 and zlib-1.2.3. Similarly, I cross-compiled GTK+.

For sox (http://sox.sourceforge.net/), few files needed modification to build
using mingw32; these are included in winlibs/sox. The rest of the official distribution
needs to be unpacked under that directory as well, and configured using the
'winlibs/sox/doit' script. avg_q no longer bundles (an old version of) sox
since newer sox supports using it as a (possibly shared) library.
