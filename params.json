{"name":"Avg_q","tagline":"avg_q M/EEG multichannel analysis software","body":"This is avg_q (pronounced \"average queue\"), a multichannel (EEG/MEG/other\r\ntime series) data processor originally developed for analyzing event-related\r\nbrain activity.  It features built-in methods for filtering, detection,\r\nspectral analysis, Independent Component Analysis, SVD/PCA, convolution and\r\nmany generic data operations as well as support for reading and writing several\r\ndata formats. Metadata (sampling rates / frequency resolution, events / markers,\r\nchannel names) are consistently passed through the processing queue.\r\nThe documentation can be found in the Documentation/ subdirectory (LyX source)\r\nor the Programs_handbook.pdf file.\r\n\r\n*Binary distribution downloads*: Github disabled the service providing arbitrary\r\nfile downloads.
